"""
This is a script that takes an ALOE report file and generates a CSV row of the statistics values. 
The user can specify an optional prefix string to be prepended to the CSV row.

  Usage: python3 generate_csv_from_report.py report.txt [optional: affect_name] >> out.csv

This script can be used in conjunction with the redirect utility to compound an archive of results
for data analysis in spreadsheet software. It is up to the user to provide the proper column headings.
Note that this script is written in Python 3.
